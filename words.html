                                        <h2>Since When Did We Start Using “Sketchy” to Describe Low-Income Minority Neighborhoods?</h2>
                                        <h4>August 9, 2014</h4>

                                    <p>I say we because I was one of those people who used to use the word “sketchy” to describe dangerous and unstable neighborhoods. I had no other words I could use. Here’s the thing, I just used two other words to describe those neighborhoods: dangerous and unstable. Two other words I could’ve used, but the problem was, I didn’t have the facts to back it up. Sure, I heard rumors of people being assaulted, murdered, attacked in those neighborhoods, but I never took the time to look it up, so instead, I resorted to the word, “sketchy.” Sketchy feels comfortable to use. It doesn’t communicate assumptions. Use the word ‘dangerous’ and you’ll be asked details about instances of danger that you can't confirm. Use sketchy and it’s a universal agreement. It’s sketchy because it <em>is</em>. But what does sketchy actually mean?</p>
                                    <p>This past summer, I had trouble finding housing in DC with three other people. We had a couple of options. They were in NoMa, DuPont Circle, and Georgetown. Three of us had settled on NoMa: it was the cheapest option and closest to the metro. The remaining member of our group, however, refused to live anywhere that wasn’t northwest DC or Georgetown.  </p>
                                    <p>“I don't want to scare people or anything, but we really have been advised to be in NW, and this area, at least on Google Street view, doesn't look the greatest,” she wrote to us in an e-mail. In the image, the houses were in rows that had peeling paint and the appearance of falling apart. She said the area looked “sketchy," and we assured her it would be fine despite its “sketchiness.” She sent another email, this time with crime statistics. DuPont had 34 instances of violent crime, Georgetown had zero, and NoMa had 46. She urged us to choose Georgetown, but was okay with DuPont (which we ended up choosing). In my mind, I paused – why was DuPont still okay? DuPont had 34 more instances of crime than Georgetown and only 12 less than NoMa. In the same set of statistics, DuPont had more instances of total crime, totaling 309 and NoMa with 200. NoMa was sketch, but DuPont wasn’t. Why?</p>
                                    <p>I knew why. Why she didn’t want to live in the area, why it was “sketchy," but none of us would say it. Doing so would mean confronting a uncomfortable conversation about racism, discrimination, and prejudice, which we all wanted to avoid. For a period of my life, I lived in a “sketchy” part of Philadelphia, but nobody who lived there called it “sketchy.” We called it the hood. People outside looking in called it the ghetto, a term that has been replaced with "sketchy." It was where families on food stamps lived. It was where people who worked hard for the American Dream but were still barely scraping by lived. The neighborhood was predominantly African-American with a couple Asian immigrant families sprinkled in. </p>
                                    <p>I hated using the word “sketchy”, but I was grateful it existed. Using it meant that I didn’t have to confront people. I didn’t have to say, “Just because the majority of people who live here are African-American doesn’t mean it’s dangerous,” because they’d respond with anger, claiming they never said a word about race. I could pretend to understand them and say, “It’s not that sketchy anymore, it’s unbelievably gentrified” because I knew it would calm them. But I knew saying that wasn’t really what would calm them down. Under the surface of the sentence, it was code for “a lot of wealthy white individuals are moving in” and it made them feel safer. I learned another language, and while it didn’t make communicating clearer, it made it much easier. </p>
                                    <p>The use of the word “sketchy” is why I find one of the finalists of NYC BigApps, “SketchFactor” particularly worrying. SketchFactor is an app that, on its website, calls itself  “a crowdsourced navigation app that shows the relative sketchiness of an area, based on user input and publicly available data sets.” The founders refute accusations of racism by defining sketchiness as including everything from catcalling to racial profiling. One problem – that’s not how people use the word sketchy. When I meet a white guy who describes me as being exotic and "hot because she's Asian," I identify him as being racist. I don't go to the word sketchy; he’s defining me by my race and that’s racist. Furthermore, I don’t assume that because one white guy at a college party does it, the whole university is automatically “sketchy.”  </p>
                                    <p>The app, however, seeks to define <em>areas</em> of sketchiness: neighborhoods to stay out of and avoid. When I was waiting for the bus in Georgetown at night, I encountered inappropriate looks that made me feel uncomfortable. Yet even as I told people of this instance, they don’t generalize Georgetown to be a “sketchy” place. It happened once in a nice neighborhood, so will probably never happen again is the general sentiment. And besides, it was late at night, so Georgetown gets a pass. If I tell the same story about NoMa or Tenderloin in San Francisco, there are echoes of “Yeah, it’s a sketchy place. Best to stay out of there.”</p>
                                    <p>The use of the word “sketchy” is an excuse for people to block off and bulldoze low-income minority neighborhoods without saying it. Not only is it a warning to avoid an area, it’s an excuse to come in and pull out communities of color because it’s a, you know, <em>sketchy</em> place. It’s a language that makes it convenient to hide racism, to avoid accusations of perpetuating stereotypes. It’s a language where someone can defend themselves against accusations of racism by saying “I never said anything about race! I only said it’s not sketchy.” It’s a language where we can live in a “post-racial” society. I know it’s a hard conversation to have. It’s one that I tried to avoid because it meant confronting some of my friends. But it’s one that needs to be had because this language is tearing down communities.</p>
